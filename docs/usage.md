# Usage

ona-tasking provides a good base for implementing tasking in your own project.

At these time, this includes:

* [Tasking models](https://github.com/onaio/tasking/blob/master/docs/models)
* [API](https://github.com/onaio/tasking/tree/master/docs/api) - in which the models above are exposed as API endpoints using [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
