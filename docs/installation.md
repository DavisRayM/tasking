# Installation

## Official releases

```sh
pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/onaio/tasking.git#egg=ona-tasking
```

You can also install a specific tag or branch like this:

```sh
pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/onaio/tasking.git@<tag_number OR branch_name>#egg=ona-tasking
```

## Development version

You can get the source code from our [git](https://git-scm.com/) repository.

```sh

git clone https://github.com/onaio/tasking.git

```

Add the resulting folder to your [PYTHONPATH](http://docs.python.org/tut/node8.html#SECTION008110000000000000000) or symlink the `tasking` directory inside it into a directory which is on your PYTHONPATH, such as your Python installationâ€™s site-packages directory.

You can verify that the application is available on your PYTHONPATH by opening a Python interpreter and entering the following commands:

```sh

python manage.py shell

>>> import tasking

>>> tasking.VERSION

(0, 0, 1)

```

When you want to update your copy of the source code, run git pull from within the tasking directory.

### Caution
    Please note that the development version may contain bugs which are not present in the release version and may introduce backwards-incompatible changes.

## Setting Up

Once installed, you need to finish setting up.  Add the following to your Django INSTALLED_APPS

```python
[
# core django apps
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.gis',
# third party
'rest_framework',
'django_filters',
'rest_framework_gis',  # Required for CountryField in Location Model
'django_countries',  # Required for CountryField in Location Model
'mptt',
# custom
'tasking.apps.TaskingConfig',
]
```

ona-tasking has been tested with [PostGIS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/gis/install/postgis/) as the database backend.  We recommend that you use PostGIS as well.
